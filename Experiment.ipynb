    "This notebook is intended to contain the skeleton of an experiment running from Edge to Cloud. The main parts of this are:\n",
    "\n",
    "## Cloud worker\n",
    "1. Leases a node and launches and deploys an instance on it\n",
    "2. Installs required software, and configures an MQTT broker.\n",
    "3. Runs a service, which subscribes to the broker and passes in messages to an ML model.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Edge worker\n",
    "1. Leases a device and launches a container on it.\n",
    "2. Runs a container command which gets data, preprocesses and checks it, and passes to the MQTT broker.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Analysis\n",
    "1. Periodically download results from the cloud and plot them.\n",
    "\n",
    "First, we start by establishing which sites we want to use. Here, we use CHI@UC, and also the only Edge site. You could also use `CHI@TACC`. Other bare metal sites will work as well, provided that you update the node type based on what is supported at that site.\n",

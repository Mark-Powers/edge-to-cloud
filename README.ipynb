    "\n",
    "This notebook is intended to contain the skeleton of an experiment running from Edge to Cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Usage\n",
    "\n",
    "Open the `Experiment.ipynb` file to begin the experiment. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Files \n",
    "The files included in this experiment are described here.\n",
    "\n",
    "- `README.ipynb` - This file, which describes in detail the layout of this artifact.\n",
    "- `Experiment.ipynb` - Runs through the experiment, including analysis.\n",
    "- `cloud_worker.sh` - Installs and sets up required software on the cloud. Namely, this installs an MQTT broker, Python ML libraries, and configures a systemd service which runs everything in the background.\n",
    "- `mosquitto.conf` - The MQTT server configuration file.\n",
    "- `predict_loop.py` - The program which gets messages from the MQTT broker, and runs ML prediction on them\n",
    "- `edge_cloud.service` - The systemd service that runs `predict_loop.py` in the background.\n",
    "- `edge_worker.sh` - The edge program, which installs and configurations an MQTT client, and then periodically sends data to the cloud MQTT broker."
